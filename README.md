My current competency question is:

**“Who won the Gold medal in the Men's 100 metres Butterfly event at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, and which country did he represent?”**

-> I modeled this exactly in my RDF data: Michael Phelps, representing USA, in the Swimming Men's 100m Butterfly event at the 2008 Beijing Summer Games.

-> The ontology (olympic-ontology.ttl) defines the schema:  Athlete, Country, Sport, Event, OlympicGame, MedalResult
-> Properties like:  representsCountry, wonMedal, forEvent, atGame, sportName, eventName, year, season, hostCity, medalType.

-> The RDF file (olympic-data.ttl) contains a real example instance following this schema.

-> In the Streamlit app, when someone types this question and clicks “Get answer”, a SPARQL query is executed on the RDF graph and returns the real answer from the data, not hard-coded text.


This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end working pipeline for a single competency question** using:

- Ontology (Turtle)
- RDF Knowledge Graph
- SPARQL Query
- Python (`rdflib`)
- Streamlit Web Interface

The system takes a user question and returns the answer by querying an RDF knowledge graph.

## System Architecture

1. **Ontology Layer**  
   - File: `olympic-ontology.ttl`  
   - Defines the schema (classes & properties)

2. **RDF Data Layer**  
   - File: `olympic-data.ttl`  
   - Contains real instance data (Michael Phelps – Gold Medal, 2008)

3. **Query Layer**  
   - SPARQL query inside `app.py`

4. **Application Layer**  
   - Python + `rdflib` for RDF handling  
   - Streamlit for Web UI
